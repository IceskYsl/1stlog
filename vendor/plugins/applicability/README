= Applicability

Many times when writing forms, it would be nice to be able to easily make fields visible or invisible based on certain conditions. Applicability allows you to easily make, without writing any Javascript yourself, forms whose elements depend on certain actions or conditions.

Applicability originated as part of New Medio's Reach system.  You can find out more about New Medio at http://www.newmedio.com/

== Download

Available from subversion:

        http://applicability.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

== Installation

To install as a Rails plugin (this is how you should install it):

   > script/plugin install http://applicability.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/applicability

== Sample Usage

In your <tt>.rhtml</tt> file:

  <% applicability_begin(:main_option) do |apc| %>
     <label for="the_option">Please Choose</label><br />
     <%= apc.select_tag "option_chose", [["Main Option", :main_option, "main"], ["Another Option", :another_option, "another"]], :default => "main" %>

     <% apc.applies_to(:div, :main_option) do %>
        You Chose the Main Option!  Here is the rest of your form...<br />
        blah blah blah...
     <% end %>
     <% apc.applies_to(:div, :another_option) do %>
        You chose the other option!  Here is the rest of your form...<br />
        blah  blah blah...
     <% end %>

     <div>This is shared between the forms</div>

     <% apc.applies_to(:div, :main_option) do %>
        Here is another section for the main option only.
     <% end %>
  <% end %>

This creates Javascript code so that when you choose the main option in your select tag, it turns on the main option stuff in the "applies_to" section (actually, because applicability_begin was called with :main_option that is the default one that shows).
