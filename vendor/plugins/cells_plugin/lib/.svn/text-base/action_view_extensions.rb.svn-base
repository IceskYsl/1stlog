# The Cells plugin defines a number of new methods for ActionView::Base.  These allow

  # located in a 'views' directory is pretty much hardcoded in Rails.

  # Call a cell state and return its rendered view.
  #
  # ERB example:
  #   <div id="login">
  #     <%= render_cell :user, :login_prompt, :message => "Please login" %>
  #   </div>
  #
  # If you have a <tt>UserCell</tt> cell in <tt>app/cells/user_cell.rb</tt>, which has a
  # <tt>UserCell#login_prompt</tt> method (this is called the <tt>login_prompt</tt>
  # <em>state</em> in Cells terminology), this will call that method and then will
  # find the view <tt>app/cells/user/login_prompt.rhtml</tt> and render it.
  #
  # If this view file looks like this:
  #   <h1><%= @opts[:message] %></h1>
  #   <label>name: <input name="user[name]" /></label>
  #   <label>password: <input name="user[password]" /></label>
  #
  # The resulting view in the controller will be roughly equivalent to:
  #   <div id="login">
  #     <h1><%= "Please login" %></h1>
  #     <label>name: <input name="user[name]" /></label>
  #     <label>password: <input name="user[password]" /></label>
  #   </div>

  ### DISCUSS: to stay for- and backward compatible i decided to introduce the
  #   cells_render method, so we don't have to hurt rails too much.
  #   currently this method hurts rails: it simply prepends a string to the
  #   template path and extends #full_template_path to detect this and set
  #   the appropriate path. i hope someone will rewrite this clean so we don't
  #   have to fiddle around in rails.
  #   thanks to james adam from whom i stole the #full_template_path trick :-)
