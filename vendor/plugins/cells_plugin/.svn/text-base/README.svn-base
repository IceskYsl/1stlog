= Overview

Cells is a rails plugin for a new concept of code organization. Instead of
pushing everything into the ApplicationControllers, logic and views are
encapsulated in flexible cells.

Cells can be described best as "lightweight controllers" - they are classes
that implement the business logic in methods and can render views.
Cells can be called in controllers or within views and plug themselfs into
any part of the page.


= Documentation

The documentation is currently being worked upon.  You will find basic
reference documentation in here.  You can probably best start looking
at the documentation of the Cell::Base class.

See http://cells.rubyforge.org for documentation targeted at cells
newbies, including an overview of what you can do with cells and a
tutorial.

== Installation

To install, simply put Cells in your vendor/plugin directory and make
sure it gets loaded by adding it to the <tt>config.plugins=...</tt>
line in your <tt>environment.rb</tt> file.

If you use the Engines plugin from http://www.rails-engines.org, make
sure you load Engines first, and Cells right after.  Any plugins that
are loaded before Cells will not be able to define cell classes because
those will not be loaded by Engines.

Cells will only work with trunk Engines or branches/rb_1.2
(or a later branch).  This branch is available at:
http://svn.rails-engines.org/engines/branches/rb_1.2
